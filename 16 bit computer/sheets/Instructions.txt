Opcodes are given in hexadecimal. In opcodes "x" represents a variable part of the opcode. The way it varies is described in each case, giving its value in binary.

001x        mov regd regs    Copies value of register regs to register regd. x = 00, 01, 10 or 11 + 00, 01, 10, 11 depending on which registers are used. For example:
                             mov bx dx -> x = 0111, because bx would be 01 and dx would be 11

002x        mov reg num      Copies value num to register reg. x = 00, 01, 10 or 11 + 00 depending on which register is used. For example: mov bx 32 -> x = 0100,
                             because bx would be 01

003x        mov reg add

004x        mov add reg

005x        mov add num
